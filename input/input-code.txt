Explanation:

<!DOCTYPE html>: This declaration defines the document type and version of HTML. In this case, it indicates that the document is an HTML5 document.

<html>: This tag is the root element of an HTML page and encompasses all other elements.

<head>: This section contains meta-information about the HTML document, such as the title and links to external resources like CSS.

<title>Hello World</title>: This tag sets the title of the HTML page, which is displayed in the browser's title bar or tab.
<body>: This section contains the visible content of the HTML document.

<h1>Hello, World!</h1>: This tag defines a level 1 heading, which is the largest heading size. The text "Hello, World!" is the content of the heading and will be displayed on the page.
This code creates a simple HTML page that displays the text "Hello, World!" as a heading in a web browser. This is often the first program written when learning a new programming language, and it serves as a basic introduction to the syntax and structure of HTML.
